Our goal in this project is to take the exoplanets already discovered and see what the probability of life on these planets real is and hope that a good amount of the exoplanets that we discovered so far fit well into the criteria of haveing the ability to hold life.\n",

Another issue that we have with this DataFrame is that the names, due to there being many columns, may not be very intuitive, so in order to be able to understand the column values quicker without a cheat sheet of what each column represents we want to change the column names.\n",

    "After removing the columns that aren't useful or won't be necessary for our calculations we can do the next step of tidying up our data. This would be to remove the rows that have missing data. Now we don't have to delete every row that is missing data because some columns can be interchangable. An example of an interchangable column is the radius and mass of the planet nut in the units of Earth Radius/Mass or Jupiter Radius/Mass which we can use either value in a formula since in the end we can just convert this value to any radius/mass units that we need. We also want to keep as many columns as we can so that we can get a better analysis."
